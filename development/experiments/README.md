# Coupling Experiments

Experiments with copula-based coupling in likelihood computations.

## Files

- `coupling_example.py` - Main experiment script for testing coupling effects
- `coupling_utils.py` - Utility functions for coupling experiments

## Purpose

Testing different approaches to modeling correlations between cosmological 
observables using copulas with various marginal distributions.

## Status

ðŸ”¬ **Active Development** - These experiments inform future likelihood 
implementation strategies.
